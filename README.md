#Development Locally
## Install Dependencies
`npm install` for installing Node.js Dependencies.
`bower install` for installing Web Dependencies.

## Start the server & preview
Run `grunt serve` to create a local, Node-based http server on localhost:9000, and launch your newly scaffolded application in a new tab.
While running, each save to the source-code will automatically force a browser refresh so you donâ€™t have to do this yourself (live reloading).

## Testing
Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma, reporting to the console and to test/reports.

## Build
Running `grunt build` will create a production version of our application, by: linting, concatenating and minifying our scripts & styles, optimizing images, compiling the output of any preprocessors used, and save it in our dist folder.

## Build and preview the production-ready app
Running `grunt serve:dist` will create a production version of our application and launch it in a new tab.

## Test the production-ready app
Running `grunt test:dist` will run the unit tests with karma, reporting to the console and to test/reports.

## Build, Test and Preview the production-ready app
Running `grunt`. The default task will create a production version of our application, run the unit tests with karma and launch the production-ready app in a new tab.

## Delivery Pipeline Service
More notes about the Delivery Pipeline Service is located in the Application itself in the howTo-page, http://localhost:9000/#/howto
