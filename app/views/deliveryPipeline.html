    <h1>Delivery Pipeline</h1>
    <p>The pre-configured pipeline executes each time you push to the Git repo. The pipeline automates your builds and deployments to IBM Bluemix and consists of three stages:</br>

                <p>The third and final stage is <b>Active Deploy</b>. It will deploy the application to your destination, without downtime. The stage contains of the following four jobs:</p>

                    <li>
                        <b>Deploy Single Instance</b> deploys the new app as a single instance with no mapped routes

                    <li>
                        <b>Begin Active Deploy</b> starts the deployment process to increase the instances of your new app until both versions of your app are live in production
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>e2e tests</b> executes the the grunt command <i>"grunt e2e"</i>, which runs tests against your live application running in a real browser. Setting the env-variable TEST_RESULT_FOR_AD to 0 for successful tests and 1 for failures.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Complete Active Deploy</b> ends the deployment process and decreases the original version of your app if the test phase was successful (TEST_RESULT_FOR_AD=0). Otherwise (TEST_RESULT_FOR_AD=1), a rollback will occur and your app will revert to the original version.
                    </li>
