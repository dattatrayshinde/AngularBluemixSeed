    <h1>Delivery Pipeline</h1>
    <p>The pre-configured pipeline executes each time you push to the Git repo. The pipeline automates your builds and deployments to IBM Bluemix and consists of three stages:</br>

    <i class="text-muted">If a job or a stage fails, the remaining stages will cancel. </i>
